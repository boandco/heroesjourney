Kendall has spent the past 10 years working with ad agencies, start-ups, and production companies, creating content for a variety of global brands and networks. Her interest in filmmaking began at a young age, when she asked her parents to buy her a camcorder so she could create what she saw on TV. From that point on, she knew her calling was creating content. 

Kendall was accepted into Savannah College of Art and Design in Savannah, Georgia, and pursued a BFA in Film and Television. She began her professional career at Buzzfeed Motion Pictures, where she produced, directed, and edited media featured on their network, and on many other social media platforms.  

Now as an independent Post-Production Supervisor she lives every day doing what she loves most, in hopes of inspiring others through her passion for the process.
