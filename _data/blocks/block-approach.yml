      through 12 keystones which become lifelong social emotional tools aimed to
      ignite: passion, connection, powerful storytelling, confidence, presence,
      leadership, knowledge of world affairs and more."

  - text: As these keystones are experienced, the students build writing blocks for
      a presentation about something for which they  take a stand. The keystones
      and blocks prepare students to tackle and support their fears.

      parents have the ability to submit their favorite talks to Heroes Journey
      for students to possibly be selected for Heroes Journey’s annual Change
